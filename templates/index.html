            <span class="image main"><img src="static/assets/images/pic01.jpg" alt=""/></span>
            <p>My name is Albert Montufar, and I have been working in the tech industry for seven years with a total of
                five (5) in Quality Assurance.</p>
            <p>I've always enjoyed learning new technologies either at work or on my own time. This has lead to me being
                the go-to guy when my friends or relatives need help with their devices.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Playing the guitar</li>
                <li>Listening to music</li>
                <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
                <li>Playing soccer</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Also, please check out my <a href="#work">Work Experience</a></p>

            <p>Skills aquired in my Quality Assurance Role</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helped develop the automation framework for MadCap Flare (software from previous employer)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The framework was setup in a way that allows any member of the QA team to put together an
                        automation flow without really having to know automation.
                    </li>
                    <li>The above was accomplished by automating as many of the usual steps/procedures that the software
                        handles. For instance, there are flows available to open the application, load a specific
                        project, build a specific output etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>Automating a new bug is as simple as stringing the flows that cover each step in reproducing the
                        bug!
                    </li>
                    <li>This approach allowed for bugs and tests to be automated quickly and with little to no error
                        since each step is thoroughly tested. No need to reinvent the wheel every time!
                    </li>
                    <li>Last but not least, I also provided Templates for all major kinds of testing. My goal is always
                        to make automating as accessible for team members as possible.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Created comprehensive test plans for all new and existing features</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have experience writing detailed test plans that ensures that every moving part in the
                        new/existing feature is tested.
                    </li>
                    <li>I have written these plans from the ground up, but I have also updated older test plans to help
                        testing be more robust.
                    </li>
                    <li>I have made it a habit to update test plans after the feature goes out as well. There is always
                        room for improvements and it ensures re-testing of the new feature is as smooth as possible.
                    </li>
                    <li>If possible, I also like attending planning meetings so I can get an idea of how the new feature
                        will operate.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Manual testing</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manual testing is always the first step and I have a lot of experience in this area.</li>
                    <li>I follow the design specifications in order to ensure the feature is working as intended./li>
                    <li>At this stage, I also like to check compatibility with other modules and workflows. The new
                        feature must play well with all other components.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Bug documentation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A good bug has to provide the developer with a clear picture of the issue, its causes, as well
                        as the desired behavior in the end.
                    </li>
                    <li>I proud myself in writing detailed, concise, yet easy to read bugs.</li>
                    <li>I am also a firm believer in providing screenshots or screen recordings to better demonstrate a
                        behavior that may be difficult to reproduce.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Bug verification</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>After a bug is fixed, my responsibility is to ensure that the fix is valid and that no new
                        issues are introduced by it.
                    </li>
                    <li>I made it a habit to read the commits so I could see what has changed in the code. This helped
                        me narrow down the impact/scope of the fix.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Worked closely with other teams in the company such as Tech Support, Management, and Developers</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I was the liaison between Technical Support and QA team. This means that the Technical Support
                        group could reach out to me in order to handle escalations of bugs.
                    </li>
                    <li>I would then assess these bugs and get in touch with management and the development team if
                        needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>I would also handpick the bugs to be fixed in the current release based on what developers are
                        currently working on.
                    </li>
                    <li>After making a list of bugs relevant for the current development cycle, I would present these to
                        management and relay their severity. They, then, decided which bugs were going to be fixed
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Assisted QA team with daily tasks</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am a resource for my teammates. They would often reach out to me to get refreshers on how a
                        feature works or if they were stuck.
                    </li>
                    <li>I also keep really good notes and have great retention, so in general it is faster to ask me
                        than to search for it.
                    </li>
                    <li>I maintained a dashboard of To Do, Blocked, and In Progress tasks so that the team would know
                        what tasks are available
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Spearheaded new and most complicated features</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>I am not shy when it comes to a challenge, so I would always volunteer to test the most complex
                        new features.
                    </li>
                    <li>I really enjoy the "learning" part of any new task</li>
                    <li>Thanks to that, I became the subject expert for the Zendesk, SalesForce, and ServiceNow
                        plugins
                    </li>
