            <p>My name is Albert Montufar, and I have been working in the tech industry for seven (7) years with a total
                of five (5) in Quality Assurance.</p>
            <p>I've always enjoyed learning new technologies either at work or on my own time. This has lead to me being
                the go-to guy when my friends or relatives need help with their devices.</p>
            <p>My hobbies include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Playing the guitar</li>
                <li>Listening to music</li>
                <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
                <li>Playing soccer</li>
                <li>Watching shows on streaming services</li>

        <article id="work">
            <h2 class="major">Work Experience</h2>
            <p>My work experience includes but is not limited to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Helped develop the automation framework for MadCap Flare (software from previous employer)
                    <ul>
                        <li>The framework was set up in a way that allows any member of the QA team to put together an
                            automation flow without really having to know automation.
                        </li>
                        <li>The above was accomplished by automating as many of the usual steps/procedures that the
                            software
                            handles. For instance, there are flows available to open the application, load a specific
                            project, build a specific output etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>Automating a new bug is as simple as stringing the flows that cover each step in reproducing
                            the
                            bug!
                        </li>
                        <li>This approach allowed for bugs and tests to be automated quickly and with little to no error
                            since each step is thoroughly tested. No need to reinvent the wheel every time!
                        </li>
                        <li>Last but not least, I also provided Templates for all major kinds of testing. My goal is
                            always
                            to make automating as accessible for team members as possible.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Created comprehensive test plans for all new and existing features
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have experience writing detailed test plans that ensures that every moving part in the
                            new/existing feature is tested.
                        </li>
                        <li>I have written these plans from the ground up, but I have also updated older test plans to
                            help
                            testing be more robust.
                        </li>
                        <li>I have made it a habit to update test plans after the feature goes out as well. There is
                            always
                            room for improvements, and it ensures re-testing of the new feature is as smooth as
                            possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>If possible, I also like attending planning meetings in order to be able to get an idea of
                            how
                            the new feature will operate.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Manual testing
                    <ul>
                        <li>Manual testing is always the first step and I have a lot of experience in this area.</li>
                        <li>I follow the design specifications in order to ensure the feature is working as
                            intended./li>
                        <li>At this stage, I also like to check compatibility with other modules and workflows. The new
                            feature must play well with all other components.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Bug documentation
                    <ul>
                        <li>A good bug has to provide the developer with a clear picture of the issue, its causes, as
                            well
                            as the desired behavior in the end.
                        </li>
                        <li>I proud myself in writing detailed, concise, yet easy to read bugs.</li>
                        <li>I am also a firm believer in providing screenshots or screen recordings to better
                            demonstrate a
                            behavior that may be difficult to reproduce.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Bug verification
                    <ul>
                        <li>After a bug is fixed, my responsibility is to ensure that the fix is valid and that no new
                            issues are introduced by it.
                        </li>
                        <li>I made it a habit to read the commits, so I could see what has changed in the code. This
                            helped
                            me narrow down the impact/scope of the fix.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Worked closely with other teams in the company such as Tech Support, Management, and Developers
                    <ul>
                        <li>I was the liaison between Technical Support and QA team. This means that the Technical
                            Support
                            group could reach out to me in order to handle escalations of bugs.
                        </li>
                        <li>I would then assess these bugs and get in touch with management and the development team if
                            needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>I would also handpick the bugs to be fixed in the current release based on what developers
                            are
                            currently working on.
                        </li>
                        <li>After making a list of bugs relevant for the current development cycle, I would present
                            these to
                            management and relay their severity. They, then, decided which bugs were going to be fixed
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Assisted QA team with daily tasks
                    <ul>
                        <li>I am a resource for my teammates. They would often reach out to me to get refreshers on how
                            a
                            feature works or if they were stuck.
                        </li>
                        <li>I also keep really clear notes and have great retention, so in general it is faster to ask
                            me
                            than to search for it.
                        </li>
                        <li>I maintained a dashboard of To Do, Blocked, and In Progress tasks so that the team would
                            know
                            what tasks are available
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Spearheaded new and most complicated features
                    <ul>
                        <li>I am not shy when it comes to a challenge, so I would always volunteer to test the most
                            complex
                            new features.
                        </li>
                        <li>I really enjoy the "learning" part of any new task</li>
                        <li>Thanks to that, I became the subject expert for the Zendesk, SalesForce, and ServiceNow
                            plugins
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
            <p>I am really proud of this portfolio and here is a breakdown of how it works!!</p>
            <h2>Code Highlights</h2>
            <p>I am using the Flask framework to deploy the web application, GitHub as my source control provider, and
                PythonAnywhere to host and display my site all over the world. <br/>
                From Flask, I'm importing the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Flask to instantiate the application</li>
                <li>render_template: used for routing as well as to indicate which HTML files are served at each
                    endpoint
                </li>
                <li>request: to handle the form request in the Contact page.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I am also importing the built-in modules smtplib and email.message to send an email directly to me when
                the form is sent.</p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="static/assets/images/flask.png"
                                          alt="flask setup and routing demonstration"/></span>
            <p>After the routing to serve the homepage is done, I focused on the Contact page. <br>
                I chose to use the POST request instead of GET in order to keep information from the form out of the URL
                and used a Dictionary to store this information. <br><br>
                There is also a <span class="try">try/except</span> block to catch any OS errors when trying to write to
                this CSV file and write the error(s) in a log file.
            </p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="static/assets/images/form.png"
                                          alt="code that handles form submission"/></span>
            <p>The function <span class="func">write_to_csv</span> writes a copy of the information in the form into a
                CSV file. The implementation can be seen below </p>

            <span class="image main"><img src="static/assets/images/write_to_csv.png"
                                          alt="write_to_csv  definition "/></span>
            <p>From the data provided in the form, I get the name, email, and message and assign it to variables. These
                variables will be used to send the email and will be written to a CSV file.
            </p>
            <p>The <span class="func">send_email</span> function emails me a copy of all the information contained in
                the form. </p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="static/assets/images/send_email.png"
                                          alt="send_email definition "/></span>
            <p>This is done by creating an email object. Then, passing to it all the information that will be in the
                message.</p>
            <p>Using the SMTP library, I start the handshake process with my email provider, pass it my login
                information (redacted), and finally send the message </p>

            <h3>Hosting and deploying the site</h3>
            <p>The project is bound to <a class="inner" href="https://github.com/AK0613/portfolio">this Git
                repository</a> in GitHub.</p>
            <p>
                PythonAnywhere (PA) provides a Terminal in which you are able to set up a virtual environment, install
                all dependencies, as well as the ability to clone and manage a Git repo. To update my site, all I need
                to do
                is commit and push my local changes.
            </p>

            <span class="image main"><img src="static/assets/images/git_commands.png"
                                          alt="sample git commands "/></span>

            <p>Then, on the PythonAnywhere console, all I need to do is pull the changes and reload the site. </p>

            <span class="image main"><img src="static/assets/images/pull.png"
                                          alt="sample pulling on Python Anywhere console "/></span>

            <p>There is a setup process to get this all up and running in PythonAnywhere once all files are ready, but
                the process is simple and properly explained in their Documentation. </p>

            <p>The last step, which is still ongoing, is adding more content to the site. I am incredibly familiar with
                HTML5 and CSS, so it has been easy to modify the template, add content, add CSS rules, etc. </p>

            <p>I will be adding links to other large projects I've completed soon!</p>
